# GifTastic- Flower Gif App
This is a web app that will display 10 static gifs for a flower when you click on a button. When you click on the static gif, it will animate. It will revert to static when you click on the animated gif. The gifs and their corresponding ratings are pulled from the giphy api and are displayed on the page by making a call to the giphy api using AJAX. The app also features a form field that will prompt you to enter a flower of your choosing. When you click on the submit button, it create a button for that flower and display it on the page. Just like the existing flower buttons, when you click on the button corresponding to the flower you just added to the page via the form, you will see 10 static gifs with their corresponding ratings on the page and you will be able to animate them by clicking on the gif.
